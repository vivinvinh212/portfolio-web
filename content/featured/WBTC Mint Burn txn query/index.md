This decentralized application (DApp) allows users to query the most recent Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) mint and burn transactions. Built using React, Etherscan, and JavaScript, the DApp provides an easy-to-use interface for obtaining up-to-date information on WBTC transactions. By leveraging Etherscan's APIs and response field filter, the DApp fetches data on the most recent mint and burn transactions, displaying them real-time, in a user-friendly manner.
