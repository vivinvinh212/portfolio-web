Dice Game is a blockchain-based application that allows players to roll a virtual dice in an attempt to win a prize. However, the game uses block hash as a weak source of randomness, which makes it potentially exploitable. This project demonstrates the vulnerability of using weak randomness in blockchain applications and highlights the need for more robust solutions for randomness on blockchain, such as commit/reveal schemes, oracles, or Chainlink's Verifiable Random Function (VRF).
